# HOTEL-PROJECT
This Python hotel management system automates room booking, food ordering, and billing using SQLite for data storage. It offers functions to show vacant rooms, check guests in/out, place food orders, and generate detailed bills with friendly CLI menus. The system validates inputs and updates room status for smooth hotel operations.
