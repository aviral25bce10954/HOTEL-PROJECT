Problem Statement
Managing hotel room bookings, guest check-ins/check-outs, and restaurant orders manually can be slow and error-prone. Hotel staff often struggle to track room availability, calculate bills accurately, and handle guest requests efficiently in the absence of automated tools.

Scope of the Project
This project provides a simple command-line based hotel management system.

The system relies on an SQLite database for reliable data storage and retrieval.
